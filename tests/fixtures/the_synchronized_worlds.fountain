>OVER BLACK:

The sound of bubbling liquid.

>FADE IN:

Bubbles traveling upward in a blue-tinted fluid.

INT. AGAMEMNON’S CHAMBERS - CORRIN - MORNING

A human brain is suspended in blue fluid.

The blue fluid is contained by a clear, DOMED CYLINDER with a metal cap on the bottom, like a cylindrical snow-globe.

From somewhere inside the blue fluid, a light projects the image of a face, eyes closed, onto the inside of the cylinder. The eyes open, as if waking up.

Large metal tongs come down from the ceiling and grab the cylinder from the top, moving it onto a large black obelisk.

Clamps snap into place with a metallic POP, securing the brain to the obelisk. From the obelisk arms and legs "unfold" turning it into roughly the shape of an animated stick figure.

Modern, sleek "hands" and "feet" emerge from the ends of the "arms" and "legs”: Simplistic and functional.

A small ball floats into view--a WATCHEYE. Lights on the ball flash with the inflection of its generated voice.

WATCHEYE
CyMek Agamemnon, OMNIUS-INSTANCE-CORRIN requests your presence when epoch twenty-three dot nine is intializ--

CYMEK "AGGIE" AGAMEMNON, (ageless, a machine with the brain of a human) grabs the WATCHEYE out of the air and crushes it in his metallic "hand" tossing it to the ground. He walks forward deliberately stepping on the remains of the WATCHEYE, extinguishing any power left in the broken little messenger bot.

EXT. FORTRESS - CORRIN - MORNING

.SUPER:  CORRIN

Agamemnon walks outside with a purpose, heading from his chambers toward a larger building on the compound, his artificial legs plodding quickly. His suspension fluid continues to bubble. A large red sun, roughly three times ours, shines in the sky and gives everything a slightly red tint.

In the courtyard, a PLUG-LIKE SYNC SHIP with long tentacles connecting it to terminals in the ground. The PLUG-LIKE SYNC SHIP design is uniquely shaped and it is "unplugging" itself from this planet and retracting the tentacle that connect it to it’s port.

Aggie stops to watch it, projected expression unreadable. The ship takes off slowly, then gaining speed in the air and eventually traveling straight up and out of the atmosphere.

Aggie continues to the larger building.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE EVERMIND - CORRIN - MORNING

Agamemnon enters with his steps making pitter-patter noises in the concrete-floor rotunda, then he kneels. The cavernous room echos with sounds of movement somewhere.

ERASMUS (O.S.)
(Patronizing)
I trust your sleep cycles left you refreshed, Aggie?

The silhouette appears human. As ERASMUS steps into the light we can see his face is a black oval of polymer that can form shapes on demand.

The rest of his body is metallic with almost a “chain mail” effect.

Aggie's face becomes unemotional as he tries to ignore Erasmus feigning concern.

ERASMUS
You have so many--we'll call them ‘eccentricities’--left over from your human life. Any thinking machine would be rightly concerned. As your friend--

AGGIE
You are not my friend, nor am I yours--

The Evermind's booming voice comes from out of nowhere and shuts them both up.

OMNIUS-INSTANCE-CORRIN (O.S.)
OMNIUS-INSTANCE-CORRIN synchronized. Timestamp eleven-o-six dot twenty-three dot nine. We hear all. We see all. We understand all. Speak and be heard by the Evermind.

AGGIE
Lord Omnius. I submitted to your queue plans for the invasion of Selucia--

ERASMUS
I've never liked Selucia. The humidity in the air made my skin oxidize. It took me weeks to get the rust out of my--

AGGIE
(To the evermind)
--Selucia has the abundance of minerals The 'Mind needs to finish this city's--

OMNIUS (O.S.)
The Evermind has reviewed the plans for synchronization of Selucia and finds no obvious errors. The risk to EVERMIND-INSTANCE-ARMADA is minimal. However, feral humans are notoriously difficult to predict.

ERASMUS
But I hear they are WONDERFUL with some pinot noir and roasted root vegetables--

AGGIE
(to The Evermind)
I'm asking you to let me lead the Evermind Armada to the Selucian system. In these newly-design infiltration ships, My CyMeks will be able to take the planet in a matter of hours.

Several seconds with no answer from the Evermind.

ERASMUS
I think you should let him go.

Aggie’s projected face reads skepticism.

ERASMUS
No, really. I think you should go. I mean, either the humans will be dead, or **you** will, so it's really a win-win for all of us--

AGGIE is about to respond when:

OMNIUS
The Evermind orders CYMEK Agamemnon to lead the NeoMeks and synchronize the second planet of the Seluscia system. Once the feral human population is under control, you will give any help needed to the Armada to bring OMNIUS-INSTANCE-SELUSCIA online.

Aggie can't help but project satisfaction.

AGGIE
I serve the Evermind.

Aggie stands, leaves.

ERASMUS
(watching him go)
As do we all, my little bottle of bubbles. As. Do. We. All.

ERASMUS sinks back into the darkness.
